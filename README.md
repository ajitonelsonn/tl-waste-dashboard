## üîë Key Features Explained

### Interactive Waste Map

Our geospatial visualization uses Leaflet to display waste reports across Timor-Leste. Reports are color-coded by severity and clustered for better performance. Users can filter by waste type, date range, and severity level.

### Hotspot Analysis

The dashboard automatically identifies areas with recurring waste issues, helping officials prioritize cleanup efforts and resource allocation.

### Contributor Leaderboard

The leaderboard recognizes community members who actively report waste incidents, fostering healthy competition and encouraging continued participation. Users can filter by valid reports only and various time ranges to see who's making the biggest impact.

### Data-Driven Insights

All visualizations are powered by real data from citizen reports, processed by our AI analysis backend. This ensures that decision-makers have access to accurate, up-to-date information about waste management challenges.

## üåç Integration with TL Digital Waste Monitoring Network

This dashboard is a critical component of the larger TL Digital Waste Monitoring ecosystem:

1. Citizens report waste issues via the mobile app (TL Waste Report)
2. Reports with images and location data are processed by AI agents
3. Data is analyzed, classified, and stored in the central database
4. This dashboard pulls data from the central system and presents actionable insights
5. Government officials use these insights to coordinate cleanup efforts
6. Community contributors are recognized through the leaderboard

## üì± Mobile Application

The complementary mobile application allows citizens to:

- Capture and report waste incidents with photos
- Tag locations accurately with GPS
- Track the status of their reports
- View nearby waste incidents and hotspots
- Earn recognition on the contributor leaderboard

Download the app from the [Download page](https://tlwaster.site/download) on our dashboard.

The Idea to for create this TL Digital Waste Monitoring Network project is because there are already have many garbage place arroun the dili but citizent always littering like in the image /msampah.jpg dan membuat flooded every time it rains a lot like in the picture /bajirtl.jpg or in the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D1AoKoEOr4 and I did some research and found a file at https://www.jica.go.jp/english/overseas/easttimor/data/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2024/11/30/Dili_SWM_Presentation_Material_English_2.pdf they made a survey DATA COLLECTION SURVEY
ON
SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN DILI MUNICIPALITY
FOR
REDUCING MARINE PLASTIC WASTE IN TIMOR-LESTE but there are always people who litter, so from there I made this project to be able to help so that the community can report the existing waste so that we can know which areas have too much waste. and also this competition is very good for me to be able to use ai technology such as asi1.ai and https://agentverse.ai which is very easy to integrate ai so that there is no manipulation.

for the future in this project
I will continue the application and promote it to the government because ai is also new in Timor-Leste.
so that every month there is a prize for the community who makes a report

and make 1 more agent and 1 mobile application to collect garbage that is reported by the community
